                <h2>Early life</h2>
                <p>Clodia was born to an old and wealthy family. Her family name, Claudius Pulcher, was well established in the Rome and had a good amount of power. Not much is known about Clodia's childhood. It is thought that she went to school, where
                    she was taught to be a proper roman Matrona as well as other useful skills that she used to cultivate her knowledge. <br> <br> Claudia was a daughter of Appius Claudius Pulcher. She had three brothers: Appius Claudius Pulcher, Gaius
                    Claudius Pulcher, and Publius Clodius Pulcher and four sisters. Her mother is unknown.</p>

        <div class="info womanhood" id="womanhood">
            <img src="imgs/roman woman.png" alt="roman woman">
            <h2>Womanhood</h2>
            <p style="overflow: hidden;">Since Clodia was from such a well off family, she did not have to work. Instead, she was expected to do things that a proper roman Matrona would do, like taking care of the slaves and children. However, unlike the rest of the roman population,
                Clodia is super cool. <br><br>A new type of 'high society' class was emerging that Clodia was a part of. It was a class that rejected traditional and expected morals in favour of parties, drinking, and gambling. Many conservative roman
                men noticed and frowned upon this type of behaviour emerging, while other women in similar (wealthy) positions chose to join this new way of living.

        <div class="info lesbia" id="lesbia">
            <h2>lesbia</h2>
            <p>It was a commonly known fact that Clodia's marriage was not a happy one. And it was rumoured that Clodia had slept with several other men while in her marriage, even slaves. One of Clodia's most famous lovers was the poet Catullus. He wrote
                about her in many poems under the alias Lesbia. This name was to protect both of their identities, as they would be punished for adultery if it were to be discovered that they were having an affair. Although it was well known that Clodia
                was Lesbia in the city. <br><br>Catullus is completely consumed by love for Clodia and it reflects this in his poems. In Poem 7, Catullus calls himself Mad Catullus and proclaims that no amount of kisses from Lesbia will be enough to satisfy
                him. However in poem 8, Catullus is more restrained and advises himself to let go of the free spirited Lesbia because 'She no longer wants you'. This shows that Lesbia has all the power in the relationship.</p>
